# RoboRioCode
RobotSource Code for FRC using Roborio 

The main branch will be the current year's competition, and every previous competition will have 
its own private branch based on the competition name so we can update previous year's code to be 
up to date with the WPILIB and DriverStation version. Also all private branch commits should be 
tried and tested to be in working order.  The competition specific branches are meant to be used 
to save WORKING versions to revert to if for some reason the codes breaks moving forward and we 
need to roll it back.
